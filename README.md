# Overview:

The following model will use one of the datasets found from [http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) to perform sentiment analysis on the given Amazon reviews. The **electronic dataset** has been selected for this example to create a model that algorithmically predict if a review is positive or negative just based on its text. The model shown below will utilize natural language processing to predict the sentiment of a given text.

The model can be found on the Jupiter notebook titled ["Amazon.ipynb"](https://github.com/stevenobadja/amazon_sentiment_nlp/blob/master/Amazon.ipynb)
